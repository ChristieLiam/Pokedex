## Application Type and Description

**Application Type:** Pokédex

### Why I’m Creating This Pokédex
I chose to create a Pokédex for Assignment 1 because I’ve been passionate about Pokémon since childhood, and I still am. When I saw this project, I immediately knew it was the perfect choice for me.

### **Mistake - Forgetting To Use BootStrap**

So I clearly did not  read the instructions right and i forgot to use bootstrap and probably gave my self 4x the work by custom styling everything. But i do believe that the project meets majority of the criteria. I hope you can understand this was a honest mistake and if i had read clearly  what i was supposed to do i never would have intentionally done the project wrong.
By the time I realized my mistake it was too late to fix it and submit within the deadline, so I ask for some leniency when grading please.
- PS: I probably gave my self an extra 7 hours of work.
